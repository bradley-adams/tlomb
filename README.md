# TLOMB (The Legend of Marty Banks)
This repo started as an idea to create a basic rugby information website (hence the name). Then I got aspirations to create a rugby tipping website after getting frustrated with the consistency of previous websites I have used. After digging into some prep I got interested in Amplify after dabbling in it a bit at my 9-5 job as a dev. So started with this https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react/ and made some changes along the way. Changing some things around then after a chat with a collegue decided to start again in TS.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
